= Installation =

Download BNMatch.jar and place it in the directory of plugin of Cytoscape 



= Usage =

= External sif file =
It means importing existing sif file from Cytoscape.

First of all, import sif file through “File->import->Network(Mutiple File Type)”.

Then, press “Analyze” button to generate networks.

= Generated by BNMatch =
BNMatch, not only a plugin for visualizing similar Bio-molecular networks, but also 

queries similar networks. It integrates two querying algorithms, INM and BNM.

Firstly, make sure the radio of “generated by BNMatch” is selected. 

Secondly, input the necessary files that algorithm needs.

“Proteins” points to proteins of target PIN (Protein-Protein Interaction Network) of one species.

“Interactions of one species” points to a target PIN (Protein-Protein Interaction Network) of one species.

“Interactions of another species” points to a target PIN (Protein-Protein Interaction Network) of another.

“Homologous file” means the homologous information of the two species.

“Proteins assigned to match file” contains the nodes which are 100% matched.

= Operations =
“Refresh” button: when you move nodes or change nodes color or change nodes shape in “xxx_Large Networ x.sif” network view, “Refresh” makes the changes in “xxx_Target Networ x.sif” network view.

“Reset” button: Make the two network view to the initial state.

“Refresh Immediately” radio: Make the refresh real-time. The nodes of “xxx_Target Networ x.sif” network will be changed as soon as you change the nodes in “xxx_Target Networ x.sif” network.

type 1:

YA p1 YB

YA p1 YC

…

CB p2 CC

…

-YA pd -CB

tip: if “Directed” checkbox is select, “YA p1 YB” is different from “YB p1 YA”, or else, they are the same edge.

type 2 (including color weight):

YA(0.1) p1 YB(0.2)

YA(0.1) p1 YC(0.3)

…

CA(0.2) p2 CB(0.4)

CB(0.4) p2 CC(0.1)
