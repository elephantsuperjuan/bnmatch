# Installation #

Download BNMatch1.1.rar and extract it,then place BNMatch.jar in the directory of plugin of Cytoscape



# Usage #

# External sif file #
It means importing existing sif file from disk.

"Network1":network of species one,such as：
AA p2 NN

AA p2 QQ

AA p2 ZZ

BB p2 DD

...

"Network2":network of species two，such as:
A p1 B

A p1 C

A p1 D

B p1 D

...


"Matched file":nodes containing matched information, such as：
-A pd -QQ

-B pd -ZZ

-C pd -BB

-D pd -AA

...

Then, press “Analyze” button to generate networks.

# Generated by BNMatch #
BNMatch, not only a plugin for visualizing similar Bio-molecular networks, but also

queries similar networks. It integrates two querying algorithms, INM and BNM.

Firstly, make sure the radio of “generated by BNMatch” is selected.

Secondly, input the necessary files that algorithm needs.

“Proteins” points to proteins of target PIN (Protein-Protein Interaction Network) of one species.

“Interactions of one species” points to a target PIN (Protein-Protein Interaction Network) of one species.

“Interactions of another species” points to a target PIN (Protein-Protein Interaction Network) of another.

“Homologous file” means the homologous information of the two species.

“Proteins assigned to match file” contains the nodes which are 100% matched.

Example:TestFiles->algorithmfiles->algorithmfile1 folder

“Proteins”:MIPS-PC-cc.txt

“Interactions of one species”：yeast.intr.txt

“Interactions of another species”：fly.intr.txt

“Homologous file”：table.SC-DM.txt

“Proteins assigned to match file”：match.txt

# Operations #
“Analyze”button: It creates two initial network views according to the imported SIF file.

“Color Weight” checkbox: You can use it as well as the imported SIF file contains digital followed each node. When it is enabled, the color of nodes is drawed according to the number,otherwise is painted by plugin itself.

“Directed” checkbox: The default state of it is checked that means the plugin support directed network.Under this condition, an edge of "CA p1 CB" is different from an edge of "CB p1 CB".

“Refresh” button: When you move nodes or change nodes color or change nodes shape in “xxx\_Large Networ x.sif” network view, “Refresh” makes the changes in “xxx\_Target Networ x.sif” network view.

“Reset” button: Make the two network view to the initial state.

“Refresh Immediately” checkbox: Make the refresh real-time. The nodes of “xxx\_Target Networ x.sif” network will be changed as soon as you change the nodes in “xxx\_Target Networ x.sif” network.


# File Format #

# sif file format #
type 1:

YA p1 YB

YA p1 YC

…

CA p2 CB

CB p2 CC

…

-YA pd -CB

-YC pd -CC

tip: if “Directed” checkbox is select, “YA p1 YB” is different from “YB p1 YA”, or else, they are the same edge.

type 2 (including color weight):

YA(0.1) p1 YB(0.2)

YA(0.1) p1 YC(0.3)

…

CA(0.2) p2 CB(0.4)

CB(0.4) p2 CC(0.1)
